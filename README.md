## guessing-game-in-rust

A number guessing game in rust using method, the rand crate, mutable variables, and references

### How does the game work?

- The program will ask you to guess a number
- The number of guesses is unlimited
- The program will tell you if the number is too big, too small, or invalid
- If you guess the number correctly, the program will tell you that you won and will inform you about the total number of guesses made
